# CS 370 Module Eight Journal  
Portfolio Submission â€“ Pirate Intelligent Agent

This repository contains my Pirate Intelligent Agent project for CS 370.  
It includes the Jupyter Notebook code and this README, which has my reflection for the Module Eight journal assignment.  

**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**  
For this project I was given starter code that set up the environment and memory. This included the `GameExperience` class for storing and replaying episodes, and the `TreasureMaze` class for building the maze, tracking the pirate position, and calculating rewards. I created the training loop myself. My code handled running multiple epochs, resetting the maze, choosing actions with random exploration or model prediction, storing episodes, training the neural network, and printing out results like loss, episodes, win count, and win rate.  

**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science: What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**  
Computer scientists build systems that solve problems in an organized way. In this course I learned how reinforcement learning can train an agent to reach a goal, and that connects to how computer scientists design solutions in many areas like robotics, game AI, and automation. It matters because these systems can improve efficiency and solve problems that humans cannot do quickly on their own.  

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**  
I learned to break problems into steps. First, define the environment and rules. Then, use models and algorithms to test possible actions. After that, improve the solution through training and adjustment. In this project I did that by starting with the environment setup, then building the training loop to make the agent learn over time.  

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**  
As a computer scientist, I need to make sure the systems I build are reliable, fair, and safe for users. End users should be able to trust the system to do what it is supposed to do without hidden risks. For organizations, I have a responsibility to keep the code accurate, efficient, and maintainable. Reinforcement learning and AI in general should be designed with awareness of possible bias or unintended consequences.
